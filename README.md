# Session 1
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
should become:

10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

The data is given in an array as such:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

# Session 2
Welcome young Jedi! In this Kata you must create a function that takes an amount of US currency in cents, and returns a dictionary/hash which shows the least amount of coins used to make up that amount. The only coin denominations considered in this exercise are: Pennies (1¢), Nickels (5¢), Dimes (10¢) and Quarters (25¢). Therefor the dictionary returned should contain exactly 4 key/value pairs.

### Notes:

If the function is passed either 0 or a negative number, the function should return the dictionary with all values equal to 0.
If a float is passed into the function, its value should be be rounded down, and the resulting dictionary should never contain fractions of a coin.
### Examples:

## SESSION 3
Born a misinterpretation of this kata, your task here is pretty simple: given an array of values and an amount of beggars, you are supposed to return an array with the sum of what each beggar brings home, assuming they all take regular turns, from the first to the last.

For example: [1,2,3,4,5] for 2 beggars will return a result of [9,6], as the first one takes [1,3,5], the second collects [2,4].

The same array with 3 beggars would have in turn have produced a better out come for the second beggar: [5,7,3], as they will respectively take [1,4], [2,5] and [3].

Also note that not all beggars have to take the same amount of "offers", meaning that the length of the array is not necessarily a multiple of n; length can be even shorter, in which case the last beggers will of course take nothing (0).

Note: in case you don't get why this kata is about English beggars, then you are not familiar on how religiously queues are taken in the kingdom ;)
