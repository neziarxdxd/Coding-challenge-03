# Session 1
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
should become:

10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

The data is given in an array as such:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

# Session 2
Welcome young Jedi! In this Kata you must create a function that takes an amount of US currency in cents, and returns a dictionary/hash which shows the least amount of coins used to make up that amount. The only coin denominations considered in this exercise are: Pennies (1¢), Nickels (5¢), Dimes (10¢) and Quarters (25¢). Therefor the dictionary returned should contain exactly 4 key/value pairs.

### Notes:

If the function is passed either 0 or a negative number, the function should return the dictionary with all values equal to 0.
If a float is passed into the function, its value should be be rounded down, and the resulting dictionary should never contain fractions of a coin.
### Examples:
